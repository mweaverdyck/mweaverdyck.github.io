                                            about how others will behave? Here, participants joined a fictive online
                                            game-playing community and interacted with its purported members, who varied
                                            in terms of their trustworthiness and apparent relationships with one
                                            another. Participants were less trusting of partners with untrustworthy
                                            friends, even after they consistently showed themselves to be trustworthy,
                                            and were less willing to engage with them in the future. To test whether
                                            people not only expect friends to behave similarly but also expect those who
                                            behave similarly to be friends, an incidental memory test was given.
                                            Participants were exceptionally likely to falsely remember similarly
                                            behaving partners as friends. Thus, people expect friendship to predict
                                            similar behavior and vice versa. These results suggest that knowledge of
                                            social networks and others’ behavioral tendencies reciprocally interact to

                                        <p>Knowledge of someone’s friendships can powerfully impact how one interacts
                                            with them. Previous research suggests that information about others’
                                            real-world social network positions—e.g. how well-connected they are
                                            (centrality), ‘degrees of separation’ (relative social distance)—is
                                            spontaneously encoded when encountering familiar individuals. However, many
                                            types of information covary with where someone sits in a social network. For
                                            instance, strangers’ face-based trait impressions are associated with their
                                            social network centrality, and social distance and centrality are inherently
                                            intertwined with familiarity, interpersonal similarity and memories. To
                                            disentangle the encoding of the social network position from other social
                                            information, participants learned a novel social network in which the social
                                            network position was decoupled from other factors and then saw each person’s
                                            image during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Using
                                            representational similarity analysis, we found that social network
                                            centrality was robustly encoded in regions associated with visual attention
                                            and mentalizing. Thus, even when considering a social network in which one
                                            is not included and where centrality is unlinked from perceptual and
                                            experience-based features to which it is inextricably tied in naturalistic

                                        <p>Each individual experiences mental states in their own idiosyncratic way, yet
                                            perceivers can accurately under- stand a huge variety of states across
                                            unique individuals. How do they accomplish this feat? Do people think about
                                            their own anger in the same ways as another person’s anger? Is reading about
                                            someone’s anxiety the same as seeing it? Here, we test the hypothesis that a
                                            common conceptual core unites mental state representations across contexts.
                                            Across three studies, participants judged the mental states of multiple
                                            targets, including a generic other, the self, a socially close other, and a
                                            socially distant other. Participants viewed mental state stimuli in multiple
                                            modalities, including written scenarios and images. Using representational
                                            similarity analysis, we found that brain regions associated with social
                                            cognition expressed stable neural representations of mental states across
                                            both targets and modalities. Together, these results suggest that people use
                                            stable models of mental states across different people and contexts.</p>

                                        <p>Social interactions play an extremely important role in maintaining health
                                            and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical distancing
                                            measures, however, restricted the number of people one could physically
                                            interact with on a regular basis. A large percentage of social interactions
                                            moved online, resulting in reports of “Zoom fatigue,” or exhaustion from
                                            virtual interactions. These reports focused on how online communication
                                            differs from in-person communication, but it is possible that when in-person
                                            interactions are restricted, virtual interactions may benefit mental health
                                            overall. In a survey conducted near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic
                                            (N2020 = 230), we found that having a greater number of virtual interaction
                                            partners was associated with better mental health. This relationship was
                                            statistically mediated by decreased loneliness and increased perceptions of
                                            social support. We replicated these findings during the pandemic 1 year
                                            later (N2021 = 256) and found that these effects held even after controlling
                                            for the amount of time people spent interacting online. Convergent with
                                            previous literature on social interactions, these findings suggest that
                                            virtual interactions may benefit overall mental health, particularly during
                                            physical distancing and other circumstances where opportunities to interact
                                            in-person with different people are limited.</p>

                                        <p>The family of neuroimaging analytical techniques known as multivoxel pattern
                                            analysis (MVPA) has dramatically increased in popularity over the past
                                            decade, particularly in social and affective neuroscience research using
                                            functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MVPA examines patterns of
                                            neural responses, rather than analyzing single voxel- or region-based
                                            values, as is customary in conventional univariate analyses. Here, we
                                            provide a practical introduction to MVPA and its most popular variants
                                            (namely, representational similarity analysis (RSA) and decoding analyses,
                                            such as classification using machine learning) for social and affective
                                            neuroscientists of all levels, particularly those new to such methods. We
                                            discuss how MVPA differs from traditional mass-univariate analyses, the
                                            benefits MVPA offers to social neuroscientists, experimental design and

                                        <p>Social life requires people to predict the future: people must anticipate
                                            others’ thoughts, feelings, and actions in order to interact with them
                                            successfully. The theory of predictive coding suggests that the social brain
                                            may meet this need by automatically predicting others’ social futures. If
                                            so, when representing others’ current mental state, the brain should already
                                            start representing their future states. To test this hypothesis, we used
                                            functional neuroimaging to measure female and male human participants’
                                            neural representations of mental states. Representational similarity
                                            analysis revealed that neural patterns associated with mental states
                                            currently under consideration resembled patterns of likely future states,
                                            more so than patterns of unlikely future states. This effect manifested in
                                            activity across the social brain network, and in medial prefrontal cortex in
                                            particular. Repetition suppression analysis also supported the social
                                            predictive coding hypothesis: considering mental states presented in
                                            predictable sequences reduced activity in the precuneus, relative to
                                            unpredictable sequences. In addition to demonstrating that the brain makes
                                            automatic predictions of others’ social futures, the results also
                                            demonstrate that the brain leverages a three-dimensional representational
                                            space to make these predictions. Proximity between mental states on the
                                            psychological dimensions of rationality, social impact, and valence
                                            explained much of the association between state-specific neural pattern
                                            similarity and state transition likelihood. Together, these findings suggest
                                            that the way the brain represents the social present gives people an
                                            automatic glimpse of the social future. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When you see
                                            a ball in flight, your brain calculates not just its static visual features
                                            like size and shape, but also predicts its future trajectory. Here we
                                            examined whether the same might hold true in the social world: when we see
                                            someone flying into a rage, does our brain automatically predict their
                                            social trajectory? In this study, we scanned participants’ brain activity
                                            while they judged others’ mental states. We found that neural activity
                                            associated with a given state resembled activity associated with likely
                                            future states. Additionally, unpredictable sequences of states evoked more
                                            brain activity than predictable sequences — consistent with monitoring for,
                                            and updating from, prediction errors. These results suggest that the social
                                            brain automatically predicts others’ future mental states.</p>

                                        <p>One can never know the internal workings of another person—one can only infer
                                            others’ mental states based on external cues. In contrast, each person has
                                            direct access to the contents of their own mind. Here, we test the
                                            hypothesis that this privileged access shapes the way people represent
                                            internal mental experiences, such that they represent their own mental
                                            states more distinctly than the states of others. Across four studies,
                                            participants considered their own and others’ mental states; analyses
                                            measured the distinctiveness of mental state representations. Two fMRI
                                            studies used representational similarity analyses to demonstrate that the
                                            social brain manifests more distinct activity patterns when thinking about
                                            one’s own states vs. others’. Two behavioral studies complement these
                                            findings, and demonstrate that people differentiate between states less as
                                            social distance increases. Together, these results suggest that we represent
                                            our own mind with greater granularity than the minds of others.</p>

                                        <p>Social life requires us to treat each person according to their unique
                                            disposition. To tailor our behavior to specific individuals, we must
                                            represent their idiosyncrasies. Here, we advance the hypothesis that our
                                            representations of other people reflect the mental states we perceive those
                                            people to habitually experience. We tested this hypothesis by measuring
                                            whether neural representations of people could be accurately reconstructed
                                            by summing state representations. Separate participants underwent functional
                                            MRI while considering famous individuals and individual mental states.
                                            Online participants rated how often each famous person experiences each
                                            state. Results supported the summed state hypothesis: frequency-weighted
                                            sums of state-specific brain activity patterns accurately reconstructed
                                            person-specific patterns. Moreover, the summed state account outperformed
                                            the established alternative—that people represent others using trait
                                            dimensions—in explaining interpersonal similarity. These findings
                                            demonstrate that the brain represents people as the sums of the mental
                                            states they experience.</p>

                                            social groups are thought to have significantly shaped human brain
                                            evolution. Yet, research on social network representation and cognitive
                                            neuroscience have progressed largely independently. Thus, little is known
                                            about how the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in
                                            which it is embedded. This review highlights recent work seeking to bridge
                                            this gap in understanding. While the majority of research linking social
                                            network analysis and neuroimaging has focused on relating neuroanatomy to
                                            social network size, researchers have begun to define the neural
                                            architecture that encodes social network structure, cognitive and behavioral
                                            consequences of encoding this information, and individual differences in how
                                            people represent the structure of their social world.</p>
